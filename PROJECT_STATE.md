## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed | ⚠️ In Progress | ❌ Not Started

### Backend Components

#### Chunk 1: Core Backend Foundation ✅
- [x] FastAPI app structure (backend/main.py)
- [x] Entity base class (backend/entities/base.py)
- [x] Drone entity class (backend/entities/drone.py)
- [x] Target entity class (backend/entities/target.py)
- [x] In-memory state manager (backend/state/manager.py)
- [x] WebSocket connection manager
- [x] Static file serving for frontend

**Test Status:** ✅ All tests passed
**Notes:** 
- FastAPI app with WebSocket endpoint at /ws
- Base Entity class with Vector3, physics properties, and state management
- Drone entity with 6 behavior modes: random_search, follow_target, follow_teammate, waypoint_mode, kamikaze, hold_position
- Target entity with observation properties, role classification, and detection states
- In-memory StateManager with entity management, event logging, chat messages, and selection
- Static file serving configured for frontend directory
- All classes include proper type hints, docstrings, and serialization methods

**Test Results:**
- ✅ FastAPI server endpoints working (status, simulation control)
- ✅ Entity creation and management fully functional
- ✅ WebSocket connection established and responding
- ✅ State management with selection, events, and chat
- ✅ Entity serialization/deserialization working
- ✅ All 6 drone behavior modes implemented and tested
- ✅ Target detection system with visual states working
- ✅ Vector3 math operations and physics properties tested
